# AntiGravity-Game
Aim of the game:
Get to the other corridor - both are identical so don't get lost!
The corridors have gravity but the central room doesn't. 
This means that once you have chosen a path of motion you will continue until you land on another surface. Newton's first law and all that ;)
If a laser hits you then you'll respawn at the start point - the red rings signify their spawn points. 
You can land on the orbs and walls then choose where to move next. On every respawn the orbs will be randomly generated.

When you reach the opposite corridor the game will exit (woo you've won) - this is temporary and a game manager will hopefully be added soon. 
We'll pretend I'm working reeeally hard on this and not lying in a hammock with a G+T in my time off

Oh and the controls - point and click.
